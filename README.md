In order to start the App both Java and Maven are required.

To compile the app just navigate to the root project directory (/employeeProject)
-> Run "mvn clean install" with Maven

To start the app execute in the terminal:
-> cd target
-> java -jar employee-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 

To load the app in the browser:
-> enter the url: localhost:8080
